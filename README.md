Notebook Link: [02_DataVis_Python-Seaborn_Titanic](https://github.com/valenatherese/data-analytics-skills/blob/main/02-DataVis_Python-Seaborn_Titanic.ipynb) (if the Github link has issues, use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/valenatherese/data-analytics-skills/blob/284b83af683ff799a5c27069685dc8234e55a625/02-DataVis_Python-Seaborn_Titanic.ipynb)

Description: This Jupyter Notebook uses Pandas to study the demographic distribution and survival rates of passengers on the titanic. The analysis is done using pivot tables, multilevel indexes, and correlation tests. This notebook also studies a dataset of airplane flights and their passenger counts as well as a dataset of restaurant customers, orders, and tips. The results are presented using seaborn data visualization in the form of box and whisker diagrams, scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps with hues and custom palettes.
